      <description>After many hours of googling and trial and error, I finally succeeded in creating an academic website to replace my old Wordpress one from UNC. I probably spent more time than I should have on this ‚Äúsmall‚Äù project, but I think the struggle was worth it.
There‚Äôs a whole website detailing how to create a website using Blogdown in R (and R Markdown). I think most of my troubles came from the fact that I used a different theme than the one from their example, since some themes are not compatible with Blogdown.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm a graduate student in the Cognitive Psychology program at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, working with Dr. Jennifer Arnold. I graduated from University of Rochester in 2016 with a B.S. in Brain &amp;amp; Cognitive Science and a B.A. in Linguistics.
I am currently interested in how distributional information in language affects the informativity of different communicative signals. My hope is that somewhere along my grad school journey, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to incorporate my interests in machine learning with my interests in language learning üòÑ UNC Chapel Hill:</description>
