      <description>This is for output from Qualtrics that is downloaded in non-legacy format (for scoring on the Author Recognition Task). Before running Before running the Qualtrics survey, make sure to name all your stimuli and corresponding questions so that they are distinguishable from other questions (i.e.¬†consent, age, gender, etc.). If I have an item with two follow up questions, I name them as such:
 S01_Q1: Where S01 is the item number (or T01), and Q1 is the first question</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm a graduate student in the Cognitive Psychology program at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, working with Dr. Jennifer Arnold. I graduated from University of Rochester in 2016 with a B.S. in Brain &amp;amp; Cognitive Science and a B.A. in Linguistics.
I am currently interested in how distributional information in language affects the informativity of different communicative signals. My hope is that somewhere along my grad school journey, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to incorporate my interests in machine learning with my interests in language learning üòÑ UNC Chapel Hill:</description>
