      <description>Iâ€™m a graduate student in the Cognitive Psychology program at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, working with Dr. Jennifer Arnold. I graduated from University of Rochester in 2016 with a B.S. in Brain &amp;amp; Cognitive Science and a B.A. in Linguistics.
I am currently interested in how distributional information in language affects the informativity of different communicative signals. My hope is that somewhere along my grad school journey, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to incorporate my interests in machine learning with my interests in language learning ðŸ˜„ UNC Chapel Hill:</description>
