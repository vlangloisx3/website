      <description>After many hours of googling and trial and error, I finally succeeded in creating an academic website to replace my old Wordpress one from UNC. I probably spent more time than I should have on this “small” project, but I think the struggle was worth it.
There’s a whole website detailing how to create a website using Blogdown in R (and R Markdown). I think most of my troubles came from the fact that I used a different theme than the one from their example, since some themes are not compatible with Blogdown.</description>
