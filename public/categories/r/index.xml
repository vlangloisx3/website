      <description>This is for output from Qualtrics that is downloaded in non-legacy format (for scoring on the Author Recognition Task). Before running Before running the Qualtrics survey, make sure to name all your stimuli and corresponding questions so that they are distinguishable from other questions (i.e. consent, age, gender, etc.). If I have an item with two follow up questions, I name them as such:
 S01_Q1: Where S01 is the item number (or T01), and Q1 is the first question</description>

      <description>After many hours of googling and trial and error, I finally succeeded in creating an academic website to replace my old Wordpress one from UNC. I probably spent more time than I should have on this “small” project, but I think the struggle was worth it.
There’s a whole website detailing how to create a website using Blogdown in R (and R Markdown). I think most of my troubles came from the fact that I used a different theme than the one from their example, since some themes are not compatible with Blogdown.</description>
