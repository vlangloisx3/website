This is for output from Qualtrics that is downloaded in non-legacy format (for scoring on the Author Recognition Task).

## Before running
Before running the Qualtrics survey, make sure to name all your stimuli and corresponding questions so that they are distinguishable from other questions (i.e. consent, age, gender, etc.). If I have an item with two follow up questions, I name them as such:



#Three packages needed to install, comment out once done (#)
#install.packages("reshape2") #only install once
#install.packages("dplyr") #only install once
#install.packages("tidyr") #only install once

#Need to run every time you start a new R session
library(reshape2) 
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
