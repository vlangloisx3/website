Title of Study: Understanding Stories in Conversation

_________________________________________________________________



What are some general things you should know about research studies?

You are being asked to take part in a research study.  To join the study is voluntary.

You may choose not to participate, or you may withdraw your consent to be in the study, for any reason, without penalty.



Research studies are designed to obtain new knowledge. This new information may help people in the future.   You may not receive any direct benefit from being in the research study. There also may be risks to being in research studies.



Details about this study are discussed below.  It is important that you understand this information so that you can make an informed choice about being in this research study. 



You will be given a copy of this consent form.  You should ask the researchers named above, or staff members who may assist them, any questions you have about this study at any time.



What is the purpose of this study?

The purpose of this study is to understand how healthy adults understand language in simple stories. You will read or listen to short stories and answer questions about the stories. Some short stories have images associated with them, and you may be asked to answer questions about the images as well. You will also fill out a questionnaire with questions about you, reading, and authors.



Are there any reasons you should not be in this study?

You should not be in this study if you are not a native speaker of English, or if you can‚Äôt see well enough to do the task (glasses/contacts okay).



How many people will take part in this study?

There will be approximately 1950 people in this research study.



How long will your part in this study last?

You will participate in a single session, lasting approximately 60 minutes.



What will happen if you take part in the study?

You will fill out a background questionnaire, do the story task, fill out a questionnaire about authors, and answer verbal questions about your experience. In the story task, you will listen to very short stories and answer simple questions about them.



What are the possible benefits from being in this study?

Research is designed to benefit society by gaining new knowledge.  You will not benefit personally from being in this research study.



What are the possible risks or discomforts involved from being in this study?

There are no known risks to participating in this study.



What if we learn about new findings or information during the study? 

You will be given any new information gained during the course of the study that might affect your willingness to continue your participation. 



How will information about you be protected?

How will your privacy be protected? All of the data you provide will be stored anonymously. This means that there will be no way for anybody to ever link your data or the results of the study to your identity.



MTurk worker IDs will not be shared with anyone outside of the research team, will be removed from the data set, and will not be linked to survey. MTurk worker IDs will only be collected for the purposes of distributing compensation and will not be associated with survey responses (if applicable). Note that Amazon.com has stated that the MTurk platform is NOT meant to support participant anonymity. MTurk worker IDs are linked to Amazon.com public profiles. Amazon.com may disclose worker information. Additionally, worker information may be available to others (who submit a request) for tax reporting purposes.



What if you want to stop before your part in the study is complete?

You can withdraw from this study at any time, without penalty.  The investigators also have the right to stop your participation at any time. This could be because you have failed to follow instructions, or because the entire study has been stopped.



Will you receive anything for being in this study?

You will receive $1.50 (USD) for your successfully completed participation. However, as per your Mechanical Turk worker agreement to provide a certain level of attentive performance, there will be a number of attention check questions throughout the survey. Correct responses on each are required in order to successfully complete the survey and receive full compensation.



Will it cost you anything to be in this study?

There are no costs associated with being in the study. MTurk worker IDs will only be collected for the purposes of distributing compensation and will not be associated with survey responses (if applicable).



What if you have questions about this study?

You have the right to ask, and have answered, any questions you may have about this research. If you have questions about the study, complaints, concerns, or if a research-related injury occurs, you should contact the researchers listed on the first page of this form.



What if you have questions about your rights as a research participant?

All research on human volunteers is reviewed by a committee that works to protect your rights and welfare.  If you have questions or concerns about your rights as a research subject, or if you would like to obtain information or offer input, you may contact the Institutional Review Board at 919-966-3113 or by email to IRB_subjects@unc.edu.

In this study, you will hear short stories about a group of friends: Ana, Liz, Will, and Matt. After each story, you will answer questions about what you saw.

 

Pay attention to every story.

We will ask you memory questions afterwards --

for example, what are they doing, who is on the right side of

the monitor and so on.

 

 

For this study, you will need access to headphones and/or speakers. If you answer too many questions wrong, the survey will terminate and you will not be paid.","I understand that if I don't answer the questions correctly, the survey will end and I will not get paid.",Who is this?,Who is this?,Who is this?,Who is this?,Who is this?,Who is this?,Who is this?,Who is this?,Who is this?,Who is this?,Who is this?,Who is this?,Timing -
