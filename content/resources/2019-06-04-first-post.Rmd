This website was created using Blogdown in R (and R Markdown). Details on how to create your own can be found [<b>here</b>](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/a-quick-example.html). The repository for my website, along with any R code, can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/vlangloisx3/website).
