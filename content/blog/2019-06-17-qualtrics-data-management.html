<p><br> This is for output from Qualtrics that is downloaded in non-legacy format (for scoring on the Author Recognition Task). <br><br></p>
<div id="before-running" class="section level2">
<h2>Before running</h2>
<p>Before running the Qualtrics survey, make sure to name all your stimuli and corresponding questions so that they are distinguishable from other questions (i.e. consent, age, gender, etc.). If I have an item with two follow up questions, I name them as such:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>S01_Q1</strong>: Where S01 is the item number (or T01), and Q1 is the first question<br></li>
<li><strong>S01_Q2</strong>: Q2 is the second question</li>
</ul>
<p>…and if you have three or more questions, <strong>S01_Q3</strong> and so on.</p>
<p>This replaces the automatic Q# generated by Qualtrics. This is important because when the results are outputted, the columns will be these question labels.</p>
<p>If you did not format it this way, it’s ok. You can rename these directly in your Qualtrics output. As long as their is some reference to your design file, it should be fine. Another option is to copy your question labels from Qualtrics, and create a column in your design file that matches the label to each item. <br><br></p>

<h2>Formatting the data</h2>
<div id="setting-up" class="section level3">
<h3>Setting up</h3>
<p>These four packages need to be installed. Once they are installed, you do not need to install them again.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Four packages needed to install, comment out once done (#)
# install.packages(&quot;reshape2&quot;) #only install once (requires R &gt;= 3.1)
# install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) #only install once (requires R &gt;= 3.2)
# install.packages(&quot;tidyr&quot;) #only install once (requires R &gt;= 3.1)
# install.packages(&quot;openxlsx&quot;) #only install once (requires R &gt;= 3.3)

# You can check your version of R with the following line
version

# Need to run these lines every time you start a new R session
library(reshape2) 
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(openxlsx)</code></pre>
<p>These packages allow you to use functions that help tidy up your data. Next, set the working directory to the folder where your output file is located. You do not need to change anything in the output file in Excel.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setwd(&quot;~/Documents/UNC Chapel Hill/Research/Second Year/TVNSF/Audio Only&quot;)
# I&#39;m using a Mac, so this might differ on Windows
# The &quot;~&quot; is a shortcut that replaces the &quot;Users&quot; part of the path name. 
# You can put the full path name too.</code></pre>
<p>Read the csv file into R. There should not be any errors, but if there are, make sure there are no weird symbols in the csv file.</p>
<p><em>Note: This file contains completely fake, generated data</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Fake List A.csv&quot;, na.strings=c(&quot;&quot;)) 
# All blank cells will be read as NA</code></pre>
<p>This object <code>a</code> now holds all the data, and can be viewed by either clicking on it in the Environment tab, or typing <code>View(a)</code>. <code>a</code> can be named anything, I just chose it because the data in this file are from List A.</p>
<p>The Qualtrics output has three headers, which is unnecessary. We only need to keep the first one which has all our question labels. This line deletes the unneeded rows (which are the second and third).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- a[-c(1,2), ] # row 1 is not the header

# Note here that we are rewriting the object a, but you can create a new object too
# Also c() just indicates a vector. It&#39;s useful for selecting multiple values.

# Added in this code because R retains factors, even though data is deleted
a &lt;- droplevels(a)</code></pre>
<p>Delete participants who did not complete the study. The following line deletes rows for which participant who did not submit an MTurkCode at the end of the survey.</p>
<p>Or, if you have a specific column that determines who completed your study replace MTurkCode with that column (e.g. Finished).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- a[-which(is.na(a$MTurkCode)), ]

# Or if you used the Finished column
a &lt;- a[-which(a$Finished == FALSE), ] </code></pre>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="keeping-relevant-columns" class="section level3">
<h3>Keeping relevant columns</h3>
<p>If you labeled your questions informatively, you should be able to <code>select</code> the ones you want easily. For this particular data, anything that starts with “S”&quot; is a stim, anything that starts with “F” is a filler.</p>
<p><strong>Information on the select function</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>select()</code> is from the <code>dplyr</code> package</li>
<li>Includes (or excludes) columns of your choosing</li>
<li>Filter or add groups of columns that start the same way <code>starts_with(&quot;column_name&quot;)</code></li>
<li>Or end the same way <code>ends_with(&quot;column_name&quot;)</code></li>
<li>Or just pick and choose individual columns e.g. <code>select(column_name)</code>, no quotes</li>
<li>Column names depend on how you labeled them in Qualtrics. Or how you manually label them in Excel</li>
<li>I named mine by item names, S01 and F01, which distinguishes them from Q78457687…<br><br></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- a %&gt;% select(StartDate, Age, Gender, Education, MotherEduc, FatherEduc, 
                  Subj.SES, SES, starts_with(&quot;S&quot;), starts_with(&quot;F&quot;), ART,
                  -Finished, -Status, -Screen)

# You must store it in an object (here &quot;a&quot;) for the change to take effect.
# The pipe (%&gt;%) operator is used for efficiency, and lets you pass your data across functions

# This line lists out all the column names, just to check to see you have the columns you want
colnames(a)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="adding-more-lists" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding more lists</h3>
<p>Because this is only List A (or 1), I need to create a column that indicates that.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- mutate(a, &quot;List&quot; = &quot;A&quot;)

# You can also replace this with a number if your list is ordered that way.
a &lt;- mutate(a, &quot;List&quot; = 1)</code></pre>
<p>The column is now the last column, but this will be reordered and moved to the front later.</p>
<p>To read in more output files, do the above following steps for each list. Make sure to create a new object (e.g. <code>b</code>) and not overwrite the old one.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>b &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Fake List B.csv&quot;, na.strings=c(&quot;&quot;))
b &lt;- b[-c(1,2), ]
b &lt;- droplevels(b)
b &lt;- b[-which(is.na(b$MTurkCode)), ]
b &lt;- b %&gt;% select(StartDate, Age, Gender, Education, MotherEduc, FatherEduc, 
                  Subj.SES, SES, starts_with(&quot;S&quot;), starts_with(&quot;F&quot;), ART,
                  -Finished, -Status, -Screen)
b &lt;- mutate(b, &quot;List&quot; = &quot;B&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now we have a List A and a List B, which are currently separate. Now we want to put them together in order to add the participant number. <br><br><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You must have same number of columns and same column names.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Creating a new object &quot;d&quot;
d &lt;- rbind(a, b)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can add a column for participant. I first sort it by the Start Date, then create a participant column. The numbering matches how many rows there are in total</p>
<pre class="r"><code>d &lt;- d[order(as.Date(d$StartDate, format=&quot;%m/%d/%y&quot;)),]
d &lt;- mutate(d, &quot;Participant&quot; = 1:nrow(d))</code></pre>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="calculating-art-scores" class="section level3">
<h3>Calculating ART Scores</h3>
<p>Now we will create a new object that extracts only the participant number and their ART responses.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>art &lt;- d %&gt;% select(Participant, ART) </code></pre>
<p>In non-legacy format, authors are all in one cell, separated by a comma. The following code separates out each author into their own cell, then assigns the fake authors -1, and the real authors 1.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>art &lt;- art %&gt;% separate(ART, into = paste(&quot;A&quot;, 1:130, sep = &quot;_&quot;), sep = &quot;,&quot;)

<p>Now we can replace all the NAs with 0s, make sure the data is numeric, and sum up each row to calculate the ART score. The participant number is not included in this calculation, hence why it starts at column 2 and not 1.</p>

art &lt;- art %&gt;% select(Participant, ARTScore, ARTExclude)</code></pre>
<p>The ART scores are in a separate object <code>art</code>, so they need to be added back to the rest of the data.</p>

d &lt;- d %&gt;% select(-ART)</code></pre>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="wide-to-long-format" class="section level3">
<h3>Wide to long format</h3>
<p>The last thing to do is convert the data from wide to long format. There are a couple of functions that do this, but the one I use is the <code>melt()</code> function from the <code>reshape</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wideToLong &lt;- melt(d, id.vars = c(&quot;StartDate&quot;, &quot;Participant&quot;, &quot;List&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;, 
                                  &quot;Gender&quot;, &quot;Education&quot;, &quot;MotherEduc&quot;,&quot;FatherEduc&quot;,
                                  &quot;Subj.SES&quot;,&quot;SES&quot;, &quot;ARTScore&quot;, &quot;ARTExclude&quot;),
             variable.name = &quot;Item&quot;, value.name = &quot;Response&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: attributes are not identical across measure variables; they will
## be dropped</code></pre>
<p>The warning about attributes means that the number of factors differ across the items. For example, for some items, everyone agreed on the same item, but for other items it was varied. This warning is okay and is expected.</p>
<p>The variables in the <code>id.vars</code> are ones that stay consistent across the participants. The last remaining variables <strong>must</strong> be your item (S01_Q#) and participant responses, because those differ across participants. If this is not the case, something will go wrong.</p>
<p>Now to order by <code>Participant</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>wideToLong &lt;- wideToLong[order(wideToLong$Participant),]</code></pre>
<p>Last thing is to create a question column, that will tell us whether a row is Question 1 or Question 2 (or 3 and so on). To do this, separate the current <code>Item</code> column into two distinct columns (S01_Q1 to S01 and Q1). If there are none, then skip this step. Again, if they are <strong>labeled correctly</strong>, this is easy to do.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#This separates the item column into Item and Question#

wideToLong &lt;- wideToLong %&gt;% separate(Item, into = c(&quot;Item&quot;,&quot;Question&quot;), sep = &quot;_&quot;)

#Ok but maybe I want to get rid of all the characters in that column, and leave just the number
#You do not have to 
wideToLong$Question &lt;- gsub(&quot;[a-zA-Z ]&quot;, &quot;&quot;, wideToLong$Question)</code></pre>
<p><br><br></p>

<div id="merging-with-the-design-in-progress" class="section level3">
<h3>Merging with the design (in progress)</h3>
<p>Using the same code as before, set the working directory to where the design file is. Then import the file.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setwd(&quot;~/Dropbox/Val and Jennifer/Transfer Verbs NSF&quot;)

design &lt;- read.xlsx(&quot;TVNSF design.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 1)</code></pre>
<p>Now we will combine any information we want from the design sheet and the results to create a master dataset. You can either include the entire design sheet, or just parts of it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Option 1: Just merge the two together.

<div id="exporting-to-excel" class="section level2">
<h2>Exporting to Excel</h2>
