<p>After many hours of googling and trial and error, I finally succeeded in creating an academic website to replace my old Wordpress one from UNC. I probably spent more time than I should have on this “small” project, but I think the struggle was worth it.</p>
<p>There’s a whole website detailing how to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/a-quick-example.html"><b>create a website</b></a> using Blogdown in R (and R Markdown). I think most of my troubles came from the fact that I used a different theme than the one from their example, since some themes are not compatible with Blogdown. Then, to further complicate things, I set it up so that any updates to my website must be pushed to my one and only repository on Github.</p>
<p>In the end, I don’t really know how I got everything to work, but it works! Including my rainbow wug favicon.</p>
