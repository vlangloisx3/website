Iâ€™m a graduate student in the Cognitive Psychology program at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, working with Dr. Jennifer Arnold. I graduated from University of Rochester in 2016 with a B.S. in Brain & Cognitive Science and a B.A. in Linguistics.

I am currently interested in how distributional information in language affects the informativity of different communicative signals. My hope is that somewhere along my grad school journey, I'll be able to incorporate my interests in machine learning with my interests in language learning :smile:
