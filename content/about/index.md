Hello. Iâ€™m a graduate student in the Cognitive Psychology program at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. I work with Dr. Jennifer Arnold on language processing and production. I graduated from University of Rochester in 2016 with a B.S. in Brain & Cognitive Science and a B.A. in Linguistics.
